# Next.js Prototyping Starter Pack

This starter pack provides a foundation for building modern web applications with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/UI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Homebrew** (macOS package manager):
  - If you don't have Homebrew, open your terminal and paste the following command:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
- **Node.js**:
  - Install using Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install node
    ```
- **Git**:
  - Install using Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```
- **Cursor**:
  - Download and install from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project (e.g. a folder code where you can put all your projects).
    - Run the following command:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Jochen3000/next-prototype-starter.git
      ```
    - Change into the project directory:
      ```bash
      cd next-prototype-starter
      ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:

    - This project uses npm (Node Package Manager), which comes with Node.js. Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

## Vibe Coding with Cursor

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that can help you write, understand, and refactor code more efficiently.

- **Open the project in Cursor**: Launch Cursor and open the cloned project folder.
- **Chat with your codebase**: Use the chat interface (often accessible via `Cmd+K` or a dedicated panel) to ask questions about the code, request changes, or generate new code.

  - For example, you can select a piece of code and ask Cursor to explain it, refactor it, or add a new feature based on it.
  - You can also ask general programming questions or ask for boilerplate code.

- **Start the development server**:
- Open a terminal in cursor and start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser to see the application.

Happy coding!
